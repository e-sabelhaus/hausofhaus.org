# Pretty cool, thats what :)

Basically, I wanted a reason to do more development in my spare time.
And I have really been getting more and more involved with NodeJS, so
I thought I would build my personal website using ExpressJS as my server
framework, and for handling posts, I am using Poet.

I might also build a portion of the side in Ruby later on, because like NodeJS, I have
been digging my feet in on some Ruby on Rails development, and I like like
the native integration SASS css has with it :)

## Things to look forward to

I think I am going to try to build some cool features into the site.

### Namely, I am looking to implement:

- User Authentication
- Comment functionality
- Reactive and Pretty designs (shout out to Zurb Foundation)
- Integrate with different web services (not sure which ones yet)

## Why not just use Wordpress?

Because I am tired of being locked into a PHP based web server...

Sorry to all the folks who are big PHP devs, but it's just not my bag.

## Why Hausofhaus?

Well, my last name is in fact Sabelhaus, which is a mouthful to say.
My first name is Eric, which is a pretty common name.
So, to differentiate from others named Eric, I sometimes go by simply, Haus.
One day, when I was planning out buying my home, a fellow dev in the office
mentioned "Haus on House", and I like the way it sounded!

So here we are. `hausofhaus.org`

Thats about it for this post. Thanks for reading
