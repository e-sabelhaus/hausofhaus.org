#Testing 123
Recently, I attended a software engineering conference, and one of the themes that was presented was testing. More specifically, building automated testing to support Test Driven Development(TDD), Behavior Driven Development(BDD), and Design Driven Development(D3). These practices lend themselves to Scrum, and in doing so make for much more rapid development, while still preserving code quality.

I have been leaning more toward BDD myself, and I have been doing so using Unit Testing. From my Java experience, unit tests are a pretty normal thing, but I had never ventured into this territory with NodeJS. The tool I have taken on building as part of my job, is prestige, an NPM module which I am slowly but surely authoring. I had to dig a bit to find all the info I would need in order to build a functional unit test suite in Node, and I thought I might share my findings thus far.
